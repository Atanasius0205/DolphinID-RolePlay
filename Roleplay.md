**What is roleplay?**
Roleplay is the term that defines playing the role of a character in a game.
In minecity rp you must play the role of the citizen you want to be.
You can pretend to be a rude boss of one of the most dangerous gangs in the city, however you should behave as such.
You can also be a normal and hardworking citizen who simply enjoys working and spending some free time doing outdoor activities.
Always behave and act like a normal real life person.
