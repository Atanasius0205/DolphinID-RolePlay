**What is roleplay?**
Roleplaying - Taking the role of a specific individual, acting their life out in the path you see fit.
In minecity rp you must play the role of the citizen you want to be.
You can pretend to be a rude boss of one of the most dangerous gangs in the city, however you should behave as such.
You can also be a normal and hardworking citizen who simply enjoys working and spending some free time doing outdoor activities.
Always behave and act like a normal real life person.

In the term roleplay there are certain things that are prohibited and could lead to a penalty or even a permanent ban.
It is totally forbidden to do things that a normal person would never do.
For example, jumping off a plane without a parachute, shooting everyone in the streets for no reason, or having a gun pointed at you and you start running or hitting the criminal. Knowing that the criminal could kill you with the gun.
Remember that when you talking with another user you must introduce yourself and ask his name, it is assumed that if you do not know him you should not know it - although you can see it in the chat-

**Roleplay Definitions   **                                                                                             
**DM:** DeathMatching - Killing someone without a valid Roleplay reason. This rule counts for almost all servers, No one wants to be killed for no reason. It gets annoying.

**CK:** Character Kill - Suicide, any form of killing yourself that kills them permanently.

**PK:** Player Kill - When another player kills you, for example shootout or fight. You goto hospital, get treated and stay alive though always take care of your life as something essential, The wrong thing would be to go looking for the user who killed you and kill him. This is prohibited.

**MG:** Metagaming - Using OOC info for an IC benefit, for example I am spectating John, and another gang is around the corner. I TP to him, ICly tell him that they're round the corner and go away.

**PG:** Forcing roleplay on another individual, causing potential unfair and unrealistic actions with, for example John is surrounded by SWAT with M4's, he pulls a knife out and kills them all instantly without even giving them time to react. Another example is "/me hits someone knocking them out" there is no reaction time given.

**NER:** No environment role -This is when the user does not properly play anything that happens around him, for example if there is a shooting near you, it is normal to run and seek shelter. Another example is if a thief wants to steal your things and you to avoid it run or hit him even knowing that he can kill you, Another example would be that: the police ask you to stop and ask you to identify yourself and take your things out to check them and you simply ignore them or run.

**BH**: Bunnyhopping - Repeatedly jumping around to get somewhere quicker.

**Chicken Running:** Running around in a Zig-Zag so they can't get a shot on you.
