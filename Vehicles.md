Of course, as is to be expected from a city, we have vehicles. With which you can transport more easily and quickly.
Additional to give life to the city.
We have some cars, motorcycles, planes and helicopters and we plan to add more and more vehicles to give users more variety.

Well now the next thing you should do is raise enough money to buy your first vehicle in _Acacia Car DealerShip_ (CMD:/Gps start cardealership)
To see the location.

Now that you bought your vehicle you can spam it by pressing **Right-Click** on the street with the vehicle in hand.
_The vehicles come without fuel so you should take a little before buying your vehicle._

Now that you have your spawned vehicle you can open the vehicle menu by pressing **Sneak + Right-Click**
or drive your vehicle by pressing just **Right-Click**.
_If your vehicle does not move it is because you have no fuel._
